This is my first post. I’ll use this space for research notes, methods write-ups, and reproducible examples as I work on Bayesian mixture modeling and simulation studies.

## What to expect
- Short technical notes (RJMCMC, mixture models, SEM)
- Occasional “how-to” posts (R, HPC/Slurm, Mplus workflows)
- Updates on working papers and tutorials
